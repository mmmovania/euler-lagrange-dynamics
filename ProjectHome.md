This Euler-Lagrange modelling package provides an easy way (graphical or easy syntax) to symbolically derive the Euler-Lagrange equation and generate formulas for the corresponding set of ODE's. In a next step this set of ODE's are solved numerically to obtain the dynamic behaviour of all the degrees of freedom (DOF'd) and their velocities. The result is visualized using matplotlib and collected in a text file called data.txt. This package is most useful for tasks requiring the analysis of a more complex system (mechanical systems, chemical systems, ...) or for educational purposes.
